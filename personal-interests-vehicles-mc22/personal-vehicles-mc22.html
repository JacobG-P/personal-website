        <h2>Vehicle Overview</h2>
        <p>I purchased this MC22 in April 2024 from a mate. It’s a 1999 model with a 250cc engine—much faster than anything I’ve ever owned. Since I’m still on my RE license, I’m a bit limited in what I can ride.</p> 
        <p>Despite its small engine, it sounds much faster than it is, revving up to 18,000 RPM. Both its look and sound are incredible.</p>

        <p>I did stack it—it was pretty much my fault. The damages weren’t too bad: I had to replace the left mirror and indicators and repaint most of the left side. It’s fairly discreet but noticeable upon closer inspection, with cracks and scratches on the fairings. I was due for new fairings anyway.</p>        
        <p>Most importantly, I was fine. Clothes got ripped but nothing severe other than a really swollen knee.</p>
        <p>I stacked it pretty close to home. It was just comestic damage and was able to tie everything together with my earphones to make it back.</p>
