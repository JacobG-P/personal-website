    <h1>E36</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>Vehicle Overview</h2>
        <p>I purchased my 1992 E36 318is white coupe in August 2021 with 224,000 km on the odometer.</p>

        <h2>Modifications</h2>

        <h3>1. Purple Tag (E46/Z3 Steering Rack)</h3>
        <p>The upgraded steering rack reduces the ratio between steering wheel input and steering angle, making it my favorite modification. It enhances the vehicle's responsiveness, making the car much more exciting to drive.</p>

        <h3>2. BC Coilovers with Custom Spring Rates</h3>
        <p>The front suspension consists of true coilovers (combined spring and damper) with a spring rate of 8 kg/mm. The rear suspension uses a separate perch spring with a 12 kg/mm spring rate and damper. The suspension setup is height- and dampening-adjustable, with camber adjustment available in the front.</p>
        <p>I opted for stiffer spring rates to achieve a more responsive driving experience, choosing the rates with some guidance from online sources. The front and rear spring rates are heavily offset, tailored to the car’s configuration and my desired setup.</p>
        <p>With the car’s center of gravity (COG) at 52:48 (front-to-rear) and relatively low, I calculated the approximate front bias for the suspension to be 60:40. This balance accommodates both normal and less probable loading scenarios across different speeds, deceleration rates, and cornering forces. The selected spring rates offered the ideal setup for my needs, making the vehicle feel significantly more responsive—almost like a go-kart.</p>

        <h3>3. E46 Control Arms</h3>
        <p>I installed these arms with the intention of adding a steering angle kit to increase the car's maximum steering angle. However, I decided against purchasing the kit due to its high price relative to its functionality and materials. While there were cheaper alternatives, the lack of material specifications raised concerns.</p>
        <p>The E46 control arms are slightly wider, giving the car a more aggressive stance. They were initially purchased to increase clearance in the wheel well for the steering angle kit. Made of aluminum (instead of the stock E36 steel arms), the E46 arms are both lighter and thicker. However, their thickness required some modification to prevent rubbing on the inner side of the rotor. Additionally, since the arms are slightly longer, I replaced the steering tie rods with E90 tie rods, cut to the appropriate length.</p>

        <h3>4. General Maintenance</h3>
        <p>The vehicle had noticeable shaking at higher speeds, which I resolved by upgrading the suspension and replacing worn bushings.</p>

        <h3>Current</h3>
        <p>I really enjoyed driving this and having it around. I don't drive as much as I should. I had plans of installing a M-sport bumper, however, sold it and looking to the sell car.</p>
