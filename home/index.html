    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>Hi, my name is Jacob Garcia-Pavy. I created this site to share more about my personal life, including my hobbies, interests, and projects.</p> 
    <p>I have been a big fan of 3D printing ever since purchasing my first printer at the start of 2023. I was fascinated by the idea of creating virtually anything, inspired by thoughts of personal projects.</p> 
    <p>I have utilised 3D printing to fund my personal endeavours in several ways: designing and/or printing for others; creating products for my personal vehicle, an E36, which I upload for others to download at a price on Cults (linked in the footer); commissioning designs through partnerships like OctoClassic (linked in the footer), which leases and manufactures my designs for customers; and flipping 3D printers, owning and testing a wide variety of machines.</p>
    <p>In my free time, I stay quite active. I enjoy going to the gym, playing basketball and futsal, and going for runs. Also, I am trying to learn German and Spanish.</p> 
    <p>What excites me the most is learning new skills and concepts. I love problem-solving and tackling challenges. Feel free to check out my personal projects or episodes, along with the stories behind them.</p>
