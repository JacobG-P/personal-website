    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>Hi, my name is Jacob Garcia-Pavy. I created this site to share more about my personal life, including my hobbies, interests, and projects.</p> 
    <p>I have been a big fan of 3D printing ever since purchasing my first printer at the start of 2023. I was fascinated by the idea of creating virtually anything, inspired by thoughts of personal projects.</p> 
    <p>Iâ€™ve used 3D printing to support my projects through a couple mediums: designing and printing for others, creating E36 related products that I share on Cults (linked in the footer), partnering with OctoClassic (also linked) to lease and manufacture my designs, and buying, testing, and reselling 3D printers. These activities have allowed me to explore different aspects of 3D printing while sharing my work with others.</p>
    <p>In my free time, I stay quite active. I enjoy going to the gym and sports. Also, I am trying to learn German and Spanish, hoping to visit Europe sometime in the not so distant future.</p> 
    <p>What excites me the most is learning new skills and concepts. I love problem-solving and tackling challenges. Feel free to check out my personal projects or episodes, along with the stories behind them.</p>
