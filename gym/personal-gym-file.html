    <h1>GYM 2024 Data</h1>
    <p>I’ve been going to the gym for a while now and have been fairly consistent this past year, using Google Sheets to track my progress. This page hosts my 2024 Summation Google Sheet, which provides a comprehensive overview of my exercises, including personal bests and totals. I record weights and reps for all working sets in the respective monthly Google Sheet journal, from which the summation sheet pulls data to display a complete summary so far.</p>

    <p>I want to expand and enhance the data for next year’s tracking. However, I’m unsure whether adding more features will be effective or actually utilized.</p>
    
    <p>This gym tracking system also includes daily information about weight, sleep, calories, and water, which I tracked consistently during a bulking stage. However, I’ve since stopped keeping up with it. There are also features for tracking workout durations, but I always forget to clock out.</p>
